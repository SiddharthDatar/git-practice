## Why do I like this article
I found this article interesting, for one thing, because it very nicely explainsthe Signal application. I found out that the founder of Signal, Brian Acton, also co-founded WhatsApp. He did this so because of Facebook's plan to use targeted advertising on Whatsapp (Facebook owns Whatsapp). He wanted a messaging application more focused on privacy. 

However, the article also talks about how Signal is ripe for abuse. It's business model (not growing fastly and then using data to target ads at consumers) doesnot alleviate the problem of extremists using their platform. As a result, the platform remains ripe for abusers, such as radicals and terrorists. 

## Note
While the artice didn't talk about terrorists and radicals, it did allude to them, and this is what I interpreted the article to mean.





###Comment from Peiqi Liu (Leo)

Thank you for this brilliant article about signal application. I previously believe software engineering mostly deals with webpages and web-like app such as Amazon, but this is the first time I learn about signal application. Surely this article broadens my horizon.
